We felt that our privacy was infringed big time. I regret going there a million time specifically because of this. I would not advise any pregnant woman due for delivery to go there and experience what we went through.

At first I was very scared but Dr. Jumbi assured me that it was very safe to do surgery much as the baby was young. We left home at 5.00AM because we had to be at the hospital by 6.00AM. We were there by 5.30AM and we were received very well and admitted to a private ward which was very cosy, nice and clean. Surgery could not be done on that day coz the Anaesthetist recommended an Echo Sound test to be done on the baby before surgery could proceed. The test was done later that day and the Cardio doctor gave a go ahead and surgery was successfully done the next day. The baby spent a second night and was discharged on the third day.
